# Ford Go Bike Data for February 2019
## by Doug Plager, 2021_08_17


## Dataset

  This dataset ("201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv" file provided by Udacity) includes information about approximately 183,000 individual bike rides within the Ford Go Bike bike-sharing system in the greater San Francisco Bay area and San Jose in the month of February 2019. Additional information about the Ford Go Bike bike-sharing system can be found **[here](https://mtc.ca.gov/node/121741)**.<br>
  Data rows containing inaccurate `member_birth_year` values, at least one NaN, high values for `duration_sec` (>9600 sec), or high values for `lin_distance` between the starting and ending station were dropped during initial data analyses to obtain a "cleaned" working dataset of 174,503 bike ride entries.

## Summary of Findings

  Increasing the typical bike ride time is likely a goal of a bike-sharing system. Therefore, after preliminary data analyses, I was interested in identifying factors that contribute to longer, common-duration bike ride times. Specifically, I was curious how (a) the start time, (b) the distance between start and end station, (c) bike id (with respect to the introduction of ebikes), (d) user type, (e) user age, and (f) user gender related to bike ride duration.<br>
  To begin, univariate analyses were performed. Because bike ride duration was the main "outcome" variable of interest, initial univariate analyses of `duration_sec` data and its log10 transformed data, `log10_duration`, were performed.  After having filtered out the 376 bike rides >9600 sec, the right-skewed `duration_sec` data contained no extreme outliers and the log10-transformed data showed a unimodal and fairly symmetric distribution. Thus, duration data was further analyzed as a whole given that there was no obvious delineation between a low-duration group(s) and a high-duration group(s).<br>   Interestingly, univariate distributions of `start_time_hr` and `start_time_dotw` (day of the week) clearly showed bike ride frequencies that peaked at traditional workday start (hour 8; 8 am) and end (hour 17; 5 pm) hours and that were around two times more frequent on each traditional work day (Monday through Friday) compared to each weekend day (Saturday and Sunday). The univariate distribution of `rider_age` also showed an elevated number of bike rides by "working age" individuals who probably are more likely to bike to work, i.e., approximately 25-36 years of age. Finally, the univariate distribution of `lin_distance` (linear distance between start and end station) showed a "zero linear distance" subpopulation of bike rides (i.e., "round trip" bike rides starting and ending at the same station) along with a right-skewed "nonzero linear distance" subpopulation of bike rides, which after log10 transformation displayed a relatively unimodal and symmetric distribution. These main observations from univariate analyses suggested the presence of a subpopulation of "work commuter" bikers and some other subpopulation of "recreational" round trip bikers among the Ford Go Bike system riders.<br>
  Bivariate analyses with a main focus on the bike ride duration "outcome" variable were performed next. Interestingly, the bivariate scatterplot of `duration_sec` vs. `start_time_hr` suggested an increased number of longer duration bike rides during the midday hours (roughly 10 am to 5 pm). Closer inspection via boxplot and pointplot showed elevated median and mean duration values, respectively, during the midday hours. This was somewhat unexpected given the apparently prominent work commuter subpopulation, which might not be expected to bike during the midday hours. The scatterplot of `duration_sec` vs. `start_time_dotw` further hinted at elevated bike ride durations on Saturday and Sunday, with boxplot medians and pointplot means confirming the elevated durations on the weekend days. Thus, the bike ride durations were increased during the midday hours and on weekend days even though the overall (univariate) number of bike rides peaked around 8 am and 5 pm (i.e., not during the midday hours) and the overall number of bike rides on each weekend day was above half of that on each week day.<br>
  The bivariate scatterplot distribution of `duration_sec` (or `log10_duration`) vs. `lin_distance` data points, again, showed the prominent "nonzero linear distance" subpopulation of bike rides. In addition, the vast majority of these data points composed a positively-sloped linear cluster, consistent with a "purposeful" ride from one location to another such as that expected for a work commuter (and typically less than a linear distance of ~8 km). Also present among these nonzero-distance points were a smattering of longer duration, presumably more "recreational", bike rides falling "above" the main linear cluster. The previously observed second subpopulation of zero linear distance "recreational" round trip bike rides was also present and many of these rides were of longer duration. Therefore, there appears to be a "purposeful" linear cluster of bike rides at least partially related to work commuting, where increased duration is directly proportional to the distance between the start and end station, and a second "recreational" group of longer duration bike rides of zero or short (< 4 km) linear distance (i.e., bike rides starting and ending at the same station or at nearby stations) that fall graphically to the left of and above the "purposeful" linear cluster.<br>
  Interestingly, bivariate analysis of bike ride duration vs. `user_type` (i.e., "Subscriber" or "Customer") clearly showed an increased median and mean ride duration for Customer riders compared to Subscriber riders. Furthermore, `user_type` vs. `start_time_hr` or vs. `start_time_dotw` analyses indicated that Customers take a proportionally greater number of their bike rides during the midday hours and on the weekend days compared to that of Subscribers. These analyses indicated that the elevated bike ride durations during the midday hours and on the weekend days are related, at least in part, to Customer riders.<br>
  Two additional bivariate analyses of bike ride duration vs. `bike_id` (with respect to ebikes) or vs. `rider_age` only showed a minor increase in the average ride duration for the highest bike_id group and, interestingly, a most-common bike ride duration of about 560 sec across nearly all ages, respectively. Similarly, bivariate analysis of the categoric `member_gender` feature vs. each of the six numeric features showed only minor differences among the three gender categories (Male, Female, and Other).<br>
  Because previous analyses indicated that bike ride durations and counts were markedly influenced by start time and user type features, multivariate pointplots of average `duration_sec` vs. `start_time_hr` separated by user type (Subscriber or Customer) and faceted across the days of the week (`start_time_dotw`) were generated. These plots clearly showed longer duration Customer bike rides (on average) during the midday hours and particularly on the weekend days. With the five times greater number of Subscriber than Customer weekend riders, the somewhat longer average duration of Subscriber bike rides on Saturday and Sunday also contribute to the previously discussed overall (bivariate) increased average bike ride durations for Saturday and Sunday.<br>
  Given the above observations, one would probably like to further distinguish "purposeful/work" from "recreational" rides with respect to longer duration bike rides. So ideally, one would have data specifically indicating which rides are purposeful/work and which are recreational, but no such data is available within this dataset. Thus, thinking about potential surrogate markers, one might suspect that purposeful/work rides would be more closely associated with:<br>
 (a1) traditional work day start and end times (~8 am and ~5 pm)<br>
 and (a2) traditional work days (Mon. - Fri.),<br>
 (b) the "Subscriber" user_type,<br>
 (c) "working age" bike riders (roughly 23 to 45ish), and<br>
 (d) the nonzero-distance "linear cluster" (i.e., directly biking to another location).<br>
Conversely, recreational rides would likely be more closely associated with the opposites of (a1) to (d). Therefore, two more multivariate analyses considering some of the potential interactions between these factors relative to bike ride duration were performed.<br>
  The previously mentioned bivariate scatterplot of duration vs. `lin_distance` (between start and end station) showed the presence of a "purposeful" linear cluster of rides and a separate grouping of longer-duration "recreational" rides. Therefore, in an attempt to better determine how `user_type` and `rider_age` (i.e., (b) and (c) above) relate to bike ride duration and linear distance (i.e., (d) above), two additional plots were generated. First, the scatterplot of `duration_sec` or `log10_duration` vs. `lin_distance` using an equal sampling of Subscriber and Customer rides (along with a separate violinplot of `user_type` vs. `log10_duration`) suggested that a modestly greater proportion of Customer rides occurred "above" the "purposeful" linear cluster of rides and across most of the linear distance axis. Conversely, it appeared that a greater proportion of Subscriber rides fell within the "purposeful" linear cluster.<br>
  Considering whether working age riders, rather than younger or older riders, tend to more often fall within the linear cluster of the `duration` vs. `lin_distance` plot, a 2D Heatmap of `duration` vs. `lin_distance` with sequential coloring of the average rider age within each grid bin was generated. Interestingly, there did appear to be a solid presence of working age riders (early to mid-30s) on average within the linear cluster and more of a variety of younger (more yellow) and older (more blue) riders on average associated with rides "above" the linear cluster. However, the wide ranging number of bike rides in the various 2D Heatmap grid bins suggests a need for caution in the interpretation of the pattern of these color-encoded average ages. Taking the various indirect evidence together with respect to (a1) through (d) above, Subscribers ride more around traditional peak work day hours (hour 8 and 17) and on week days (Mon. through Fri.), Subscribers tend to compose the linear cluster of the duration vs. linear distance plot, and the linear cluster appears to be composed on average by riders of ages that might be expected to ride a bike to work.<br>

## Key Insights for Presentation

  Overall, Customers bike relatively more often during the midday hours and on weekend days compared to Subscribers. Moreover, the average duration of Customer bike rides are longer during the midday hours of all days of the week compared to that of Subscribers. These longer duration Customer bike rides also appear to often be more "recreational/round trip" in nature and appear to involve relatively younger or older riders. This is in contrast to the more prevalent Subscribers who bike relatively more often around traditional peak starting and ending work hours (hour 8 and 17) and on week days (Mon. through Fri.). Subscribers also tend to take rides that fall within the aforementioned "linear cluster" of presumably more purposeful rides that involve, on average, working age riders that might be expected to bike to work. The longer durations among these linear-cluster rides are directly proportional to longer start-to-end station distances, with a typical maximum distance of about 8 km. Therefore, while there is substantial overlap among subpopulations, longer, common-duration bike ride times tend to involve "recreational/round trip" Customer riders or longer distance "purposeful/work commuter" Subscriber riders.

## Feedback
  My wife reviewed the slide deck of my "GoBikeExplanatory_final_v1.ipynb", and even though we are quite comfortable critiquing each others' work, she had no negative criticisms and thought the slide deck presentation "flowed well".
